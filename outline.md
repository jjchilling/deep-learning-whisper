# Title: Summarizes the main idea of your project.

# Who: Names and logins of all your group members.

# Introduction: What problem are you trying to solve and why?

If you are implementing an existing paper, describe the paper’s objectives and why you chose this paper.
If you are doing something new, detail how you arrived at this topic and what motivated you.
What kind of problem is this? Classification? Regression? Structured prediction? Reinforcement Learning? Unsupervised Learning? etc.

# Related Work: Are you aware of any, or is there any prior work that you drew on to do your project?

Please read and briefly summarize (no more than one paragraph) at least one paper/article/blog relevant to your topic beyond the paper you are re-implementing/novel idea you are researching.
In this section, also include URLs to any public implementations you find of the paper you’re trying to implement. Please keep this as a “living list”–if you stumble across a new implementation later down the line, add it to this list.

# Data: What data are you using (if any)?

If you’re using a standard dataset (e.g. MNIST), you can just mention that briefly. Otherwise, say something more about where your data come from (especially if there’s anything interesting about how you will gather it).
How big is it? Will you need to do significant preprocessing?

# Methodology: What is the architecture of your model?

How are you training the model?
If you are implementing an existing paper, detail what you think will be the hardest part about implementing the model here.
If you are doing something new, justify your design. Also note some backup ideas you may have to experiment with if you run into issues.

# Metrics: What constitutes “success?”

What experiments do you plan to run?
For most of our assignments, we have looked at the accuracy of the model. Does the notion of “accuracy” apply for your project, or is some other metric more appropriate?
If you are implementing an existing project, detail what the authors of that paper were hoping to find and how they quantified the results of their model.
If you are doing something new, explain how you will assess your model’s performance.
What are your base, target, and stretch goals?

# Ethics: Choose 2 of the following bullet points to discuss; not all questions will be relevant to all projects so try to pick questions where there’s interesting engagement with your project. (Remember that there’s not necessarily an ethical/unethical binary; rather, we want to encourage you to think critically about your problem setup.)

What broader societal issues are relevant to your chosen problem space?
Why is Deep Learning a good approach to this problem?
What is your dataset? Are there any concerns about how it was collected, or labeled? Is it representative? What kind of underlying historical or societal biases might it contain?
Who are the major “stakeholders” in this problem, and what are the consequences of mistakes made by your algorithm?
How are you planning to quantify or measure error or success? What implications does your quantification have?
Add your own: if there is an issue about your algorithm you would like to discuss or explain further, feel free to do so.

# Division of labor: Briefly outline who will be responsible for which part(s) of the project.
